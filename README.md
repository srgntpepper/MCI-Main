This is an example of a website I was contracted to develop.

This company has since shut its doors and brought down their website,
but I was given permission to keep these files on my github.

This website was created on Vite using ReactJS and TailwindCSS
with many of the assets generated using Midjourney.

There were plans to improve the website and move it onto NextJS,
but those plans were cancelled.  This is the state it was in
during my departure.
